With the increasing popularity of natural language processing, twitter bots have become a common phenomena today. Various tools and machine learning techniques have been employed to govern the tweet generation process. In this paper, we present the design of a tweet generator that uses a genetic algorithm and a tool, Tracery, for generating strings through grammars, to form tweets about a particular topic - video games. We describe the way our system works and then provide a discussion of the results. We explain what factors worked out for us and what we can change or improve upon in future.
