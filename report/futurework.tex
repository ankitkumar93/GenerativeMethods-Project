\section{Future Work}
We found that the main issues with our tweet generator, was with the selection of words to fill in for tweets and then with the understanding that tweets are very different from a normal English sentence. We feel that a lot of things can be improved to add meaning to tweets and to make sure that the generated tweets are closer to what a human would generate. We feel that adding linguistic constraints in the genetic algorithm may help us come up with tweets that are syntactically and semantically sound as a sentence, and further by using a database of tweets that are proper English sentences, may further help us here.
Further, to account for a large number of tweets which involve more hash tags and are not a meaningful sentence, we can probably use English words in our genetic algorithm as well, instead of just parts of speech tagging. Further studying the relationship between words being used in meaningful and syntactically sound sentences vs tweets that do not follow the linguistic rules may further help us in introducing constrains and rules that ensure the generation of a better tweet.
