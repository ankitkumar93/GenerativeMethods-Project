# Project - Generative Methods
## Team
 * Ankit Kumar *(akumar18)*
 * Anand Purohit *(apurohi)*

## Ideas
 * Extend Tracery with probabilistic or weighted alternatives (or another feature)
    - [x]

 * Use graph grammars to generate Twine games 
    - make mod to engine [m]
    - somehow use graph grammers in twine [x]
    - [x]

 * Make a Twitter bot that uses a genetic algorithm with number of likes/retweets as fitness function [m]
     - Generation of Tweets - (Grammars, markov chains?, tracery?)
     - Genetic Algorithm for Evaluation and selecting the best
     - Analysis of tweets (?)

 * Compare two different tools (e.g. ASP and planning) for generating some  specific domain
     - [x]

 * Compare one tool's effectiveness for modeling Eastern vs. Western creative theories (e.g. musical harmony, story beats, comics/anime)
     - [x]

 * Create a Unity extension for generating dialogue with Tracery [m]
     - Unity
     - Narrative in Unity
     - Testing (?)

 * Design a specification for predicates sets (e.g. Ceptre or ASP output) that compiles to mission graphs, tile-based levels, geometric designs, or  readable text descriptions
     - [x]

 * Create a Roguelike that uses ASP
     - [x]

 * Make a game that generates an NPC population based on genetic algorithms
     - [d]
 
 * Implement a solution to the General Level Generation Competition
     - [d]

 * Make an online, adaptive rhythm game stepchart generator (algorithmic, improvisational dancing partner)
     - [d]
